PROJECT TITLE: FACE DETECTION USING TENSORFLOW.








DESCRIPTION:
    This repository gives budding Deep Learning enthusiats a gentle introduction to the topic of Deep Learning.
In this repository , I will list down all the steps needed to get started with your first project in Deep Learning.
So go ahead, Fork this repo and get started with Deep Learning.







Dataset :
   I have created my own dataset that contain the various images of my  friends. 
In this project i have  used the Keras Library , with Tensorflow . 
   TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. 
It is a symbolic malibrary, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. 
It is used for both research and production at Google.
   Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow
Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible.
